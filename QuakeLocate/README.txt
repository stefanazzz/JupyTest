The Qloc notebook uses probability density to locate an earthquake.
Add the epicentral distance R_xxx (km) for each station xxx.
Add an error in km.
Run all cells sequentially.

The test_pygmt3 notebook does the quake location graphically at telesesimic distances.
It uses GMT pltting and computing routines, effectively running a gmt shell within a bash shell within a jupyter notebook.
In better times, I would have called this a Russian doll exercise in online coding.
This is an example of the flexibility of Mybinder environment that can manage gmt, bash, python etc.
